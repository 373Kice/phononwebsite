Welcome to the project of phonon visualization provided by the Theoretical Solid State Physics group of the University of Luxembourg.<br>
</p>

This project provides the opportunity to communicate recent research results of the theoretical solid-state physics group and by its interactivity it gives to users a better understanding of the physics of different materials. Thereby, the main focus lies on visualizing phonons (lattice vibrations) of these materials by an interplay between their phonon dispersion and the corresponding animated states of these systems. So in addition to phonon dispersion curves, the database provides a multitude of animated crystal structures and further informations about the materials.<br>

This project is the continuation of the work of Raul Weber during and internship in the University of Luxembourg during 2 months under the supervisions of Ludger Wirtz and technical help from me.
I decided to continue the project by optimizing the implementation, cleaning up the design and replacing JSmol by a self made applet using webgl.<br>

The website is still under development but feedback and bug fixes are welcome.<br>
