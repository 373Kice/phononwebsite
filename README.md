phonon website
==============

Visualize phonon vibrational modes.


This project is the continuation of the work of Raul Weber during and internship in the University of Luxembourg during 2 months under the supervisions of Ludger Wirtz and technical help from me.
I decided to continue the project by optimizing the implementation, cleaning up the design and replacing JSmol by a self made applet using webgl.

The website is still under development but feedback and bug fixes are welcome.
